#  Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) project on the Titanic dataset. It is created as part of **Task 2** of the **AI & ML Internship Program**. The goal is to explore the dataset using visualizations and statistics to uncover insights and patterns that can help in building predictive models.

---

##  Objective

- Understand the structure and distribution of data
- Visualize relationships between features
- Detect missing values, outliers, and trends
- Gain insights useful for Machine Learning model building

---

##  Files Included

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `Titanic_EDA_Task2.ipynb` | Jupyter Notebook with complete EDA code and visualizations |
| `Titanic-Dataset.csv` | Dataset used for the analysis |
| `README.md` | Overview and documentation of the project |

---

## ðŸ›  Tools and Libraries

- **Python 3**
- **Pandas** â€“ data manipulation
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** â€“ visualizations
- **Jupyter Notebook** â€“ interactive coding

---

##  Key Analyses & Visualizations

- Summary statistics: `mean`, `median`, `std`
- **Histograms**: to visualize data distributions
- **Boxplots**: to detect outliers in `Age` and `Fare`
- **Countplots**: to analyze survival based on `Sex` and `Pclass`
- **Correlation Heatmap**: to observe relationships between numerical features

---

##  Insights

- **Females** had a much higher survival rate than males.
- Passengers in **1st class** were more likely to survive.
- **Fare** and **Pclass** are strongly related to survival.
- **Age** contains missing values and a few outliers.
- Overall, the data is suitable for building classification models after preprocessing.
